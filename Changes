--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.15.4	2013 11 09
	- Added counters to be used as dollar variables. Set, increment
	  and decrement.

0.14.4	2013 11 04
	- After repairing the entity definitions with the doctype declaration
	  I saw that XML::Quote translated the user inserted entity codes
	  translated in readable text. That is, converting the & in front of
	  the code into &amp;

0.14.3	2013 11 04
	- Restored entities processing with doctype declaration. By exident
	  dropped in last update.
	- Dropped the 'writeDoctype' option from Data2xml and yaml2xml. Because
	  of 0.14.2 it is not needed anymore.

0.14.2	2013 11 03
	- Removed XMLPROLOG, 
	- Added STARTDOCUMENT and ENDDOCUMENT
	- Found XML::Quote on CPAN and removed htmlCharCodes,
	  setHtmlCharCodesRX, getHtmlChar, hasHtmlChar, getMatchChars,
	  addHtmlChar, setHtmlCharCodesRX, convertHtmlChar

0.13.2	2013 11 02
	- Plugin directories renamed so as to show that the plugin is used for
	  a specific xml variant. For the moment these are Html, Html5, Svc and
	  Docbook. Directory Xml is made for plugins which are not depending on
	  some xml language e.g. to include pieces of data from elsewhere.
	- Added PREPROCESS and POSTPROCESS commands to prepare files for use
	  and to cleanup afterwards.

0.12.2	2013 11 01
	- Removed extra newline characters at the end of users text.

0.12.1	2013 10 31
	- Modified SENDTO specification. Possibilities as scalar, array and hash

	  SENDTO is a hash or array. Default is set to STDOUT or the first entry.
