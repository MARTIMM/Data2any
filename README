Data2any version 0.1.0
======================

Software is still in alpha state!


INTRODUCTION

Second attempt to write a Yaml2xml module. Because the program is build
upon the AppState set of modules it can now make use of more than one type of
storage instead of Yaml only. Also the program makes use of translators
which can output the the results in whatever form. At the moment there is a Xml
translator. The name of the module has therefore been changed into Data2any.

This package gives also a script which uses the module to transform yaml to any
output format called yaml2any.

INSTALLATION
